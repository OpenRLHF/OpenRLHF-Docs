Welcome to OpenRLHF's documentation!
===================================

`OpenRLHF <https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF>`_ is an easy-to-use, scalable and high-performance RLHF Framework built on Ray, DeepSpeed and HF Transformers.

- **Simple and Easy-to-use**: OpenRLHF stands out as one of the simplest high-performance RLHF libraries available, fully compatible with Huggingface models and datasets.
- **High Performance**: In RLHF training, 80% of the time is spent on the sample generation stage. OpenRLHF excels here, leveraging large inference batch sizes with Ray, Adam Offload (Pinned Memory), and vLLM generation acceleration. 
- **Distributed RLHF**: OpenRLHF distributes the Actor, Reward, Reference, and Critic models across separate GPUs using Ray, while placing the Adam optimizer on the CPU. This setup enables full-scale fine-tuning of models with 70B+ parameters on multiple A100 80G GPUs and vLLM, as well as 7B models across multiple 24GB RTX 4090 GPUsã€‚
- **PPO Implementation Optimization**: To enhance training stability, we have integrated various implementation tricks for PPO, details in `Zhihu <https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/622134699>`_ and  the `Notion AI blog <https://difficult-link-dd7.notion.site/eb7b2d1891f44b3a84e7396d19d39e6f?v=01bcb084210149488d730064cbabc99f>`_.
